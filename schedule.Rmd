Two key resources: [*Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) and its [associated tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/). Assignments associated with a specific lecture must be completed before that lecture.

Completed tutorials are sent to kanes.datacamp@gmail.com with your name and the name of the tutorial (like "Sarah Jones; Getting Started") in the subject line.

* **Optional:** Read and watch the videos from [Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown](https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/) by Chester Ismay and Patrick C. Kennedy



# Week 2: Wrangling

* Monday, June 7, 8:00 -- 9:00 PM.  Read [Chapter 2 Wrangling Data](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/wrangling.html) and "Working with the terminal" from the Appendix on [Tools](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/tools.html). Complete Wrangling A and Terminal tutorials. Also read [How to use Rpubs](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/tools.html#how-to-use-rpubs).

* Wednesday, June 9, 8:00 -- 9:00 PM. Read "How to Get Help" from the Appendix on [Tools](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/tools.html). Complete Wrangling B, C and D.

* **Optional:** [RStudio Essentials Videos](https://resources.rstudio.com/wistia-rstudio-essentials-2). Most relevant for us are [“Writing code in RStudio”](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/), [“Projects in RStudio”](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/) and [“Github and RStudio”](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/). Again, these are optional! But they are very useful for students who find traditional lectures to be a helpful supplement to classroom practice.



# Week 3: Data


* Tuesday, June 15, 8:00 -- 9:00 PM.  Read [Chapter 3 Data](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/data.html). Read the [Style Guide](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/tools.html#style-guide). Read [How to Get Help](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/tools.html#how-to-get-help). Complete Data A tutorial.

* Thursday, June 17, 8:00 -- 9:00 PM. Read [Maps](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/maps.html) and [IPUMS](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/ipums.html). Determine the data source you will use for your final project. Don't come to class without one!


# Week 4: Projects

The last week will consist of projects that the students will make. Do you love soccer or wine or NYC politics? The final project provides you with an opportunity to study that topic in depth. Your final project will be, for most of you, the first item in your professional portfolio, something so impressive that you will be eager to show it to graduate schools or potential employers. Further requirements and guidelines will be provided before the students begin their work.
