The expected workload is 13 hours per week: 2.5 hours in class with Harvard Preceptor David Kane, lecturing live at around 8:00 PM EDT and 10.5 hours of work completed by students on their own. By the end of this bootcamp, students will be able to do basic data science! The course covers the first three weeks or so in Kane’s introductory data science class, Gov 1005: Data.\nThere are no prerequisites. The programming language we will be using is R. You must have a computer with R, RStudio and Git installed.\nSign up for our e-mail list to receive updates as we move forward.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nTwo key resources: Preceptor’s Primer for Bayesian Data Science and its associated tutorials. Assignments associated with a specific lecture must be completed before that lecture.\nCompleted tutorials are sent to kanes.datacamp@gmail.com with your name and the name of the tutorial (like “Sarah Jones; Getting Started”) in the subject line.\nJoin the Discord server here: https://discord.gg/5wyvDv6HbU\nWeek 1: Visualization\nTuesday, June 1, 8:00 – 9:00 PM. Read Getting Started and follow all the associated instructions. We will do the Getting Started tutorial together in class.\nWednesday, June 2, 8:00 – 9:00 PM. Read Chapter 1 Visualization. Complete Visualization A and Visualization B tutorials.\nThursday, June 3, 8:00 – 9:00 PM. Read “Git, GitHub, and RStudio” from the Appendix on Tools and complete Visualization C and Git/Github tutorials.\nOptional: Read and watch the videos from Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown by Chester Ismay and Patrick C. Kennedy\nWeek 2: Wrangling\nMonday, June 7, 8:00 – 9:00 PM. Read Chapter 2 Wrangling Data and “Working with the terminal” from the Appendix on Tools. Complete Wrangling A and Terminal tutorials.\nWednesday, June 9, 8:00 – 9:00 PM. Read “How to Get Help” from the Appendix on Tools. Complete Wrangling B, C and D.\nThursday, June 10, 8:00 – 9:00 PM. Optional lecture and catch up session. Supervised by course teaching fellows.\nOptional: RStudio Essentials Videos. Most relevant for us are “Writing code in RStudio”, “Projects in RStudio” and “Github and RStudio”. Again, these are optional! But they are very useful for students who find traditional lectures to be a helpful supplement to classroom practice.\nWeek 3: Data\nMonday, June 14, 8:00 – 9:00 PM. Read Chapter 3 Data. Complete Data A tutorial.\nWednesday, June 16, 8:00 – 9:00 PM. Complete Data Webscraping and Data API tutorials.\nThursday, June 17, 8:00 – 9:00 PM. Optional lecture and catch up session. Supervised by course teaching fellows.\nOptional: TBA\nWeek 4: Projects\nThe last week will consist of projects that the students will make. Do you love soccer or wine or NYC politics? The final project provides you with an opportunity to study that topic in depth. Your final project will be, for most of you, the first item in your professional portfolio, something so impressive that you will be eager to show it to graduate schools or potential employers. Further requirements and guidelines will be provided before the students begin their work.\nRecommended readings: Distill for R Markdown is the main documentation page. Key sections are Creating a Website and Publishing Websites. Step-by-step guides include:\nBuilding a blog with distill by Thomas Mock.\nBuilding a {distill} website by Lisa Lendway.\nCreate a distill website and More on distill articles and deploy website by Ariel Muldoon.\nSchedule\nMonday, June 21, 8:00 – 9:00 PM.
