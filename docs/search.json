The expected workload is 13 hours per week: 2.5 hours in class with Harvard Preceptor David Kane, lecturing live at around 8:00 PM EDT and 10.5 hours of work completed by students on their own. By the end of this bootcamp, students will be able to do basic data science! The course covers the first three weeks or so in Kane’s introductory data science class, Gov 1005: Data.\nThere are no prerequisites. The programming language we will be using is R. You must have a computer with R, RStudio and Git installed.\nSign up for our e-mail list to receive updates as we move forward.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nTwo key resources: Preceptor’s Primer for Bayesian Data Science and its associated tutorials. Assignments associated with a specific lecture must be completed before that lecture.\nWeek 1: Visualization\nTuesday, June 1, 8:00 – 9:00 PM. Read Getting Started and follow all the associated instructions. We will do the Getting Started tutorial together in class.\nWednesday, June 2, 8:00 – 9:00 PM. Read Chapter 1 Visualization and the first two parts of the Appendix on Tools: “Working with the terminal” and “Git, GitHub, and RStudio.” Complete Visualization A and Visualization B tutorials.\nThursday, June 3, 8:00 – 9:00 PM. Complete Visualization C, Visualization D, and Git/Github tutorials.\nOptional: Read and watch the videos from Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown by Chester Ismay and Patrick C. Kennedy\nWeek 2: Wrangling\nMonday, June 7, 8:00 – 9:15 PM. Read Chapter 2 Wrangling Data. Complete Wrangling A.\nWednesday, June 9, 8:00 – 9:15 PM. Read “How to Get Help” from the Appendix on Tools. Complete Wrangling B, C, D and Terminal.\nThursday, June 10, 8:00 – 9:15 PM. Optional lecture and catch up session. Supervised by course teaching fellows.\nOptional: RStudio Essentials Videos. Most relevant for us are “Writing code in RStudio”, “Projects in RStudio” and “Github and RStudio”. Again, these are optional! But they are very useful for students who find traditional lectures to be a helpful supplement to classroom practice.\nWeek 3: Data\nMonday, June 14, 8:00 – 9:15 PM. Read Chapter 3 Data. Complete Data A.\nWednesday, June 16, 8:00 – 9:15 PM. Complete Data A, Data Webscraping and Data API.\nThursday, June 17, 8:00 – 9:15 PM. Optional lecture and catch up session. Supervised by course teaching fellows.\nOptional: TBA\nWeek 4: Projects\nThe last week will consist of projects that the students will make. Do you love soccer or wine or NYC politics? The final project provides you with an opportunity to study that topic in depth. Your final project will be, for most of you, the first item in your professional portfolio, something so impressive that you will be eager to show it to graduate schools or potential employers. Further requirements and guidelines will be provided before the students begin their work.\n\n\n\n",
